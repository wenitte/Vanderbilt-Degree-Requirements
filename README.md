#Computer Engineering

THE program in computer engineering deals with the organization, design, and application of digital processing systems as general-purpose computers or as embedded systems, i.e., components of information processing, control, and communication systems. The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital technology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer engineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at hand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based system. Whatever the undertaking, the comprehensive academic training in this program enables engineers to evaluate the impact of their decisions, whether working with hardware, software, or the interface between the two.

The computer engineering program combines fundamental core requirements with flexibility to allow students to specialize in a variety of emphasis areas within the program. The curriculum includes requirements in the basic sciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives that combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering who wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to select their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that option. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.

##Undergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors Program. To achieve honors status, the student must:

achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.
complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (EECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report.
complete 6 hours of EECE program elective credit from the following list:
a. up to3 additional hours of undergraduate research (EECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or b. design domain expertise (DE) courses beyond the one course required by the program, or

CS 3259, CS 3892, CS 4287, or 5000-level courses.

The diploma designation is Honors in Computer Engineering.
