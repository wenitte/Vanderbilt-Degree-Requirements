# Computer Science


THE program in computer science blends scientific and engineering principles, theoretical analysis, and actual
computing experience to provide undergraduate students with a solid foundation in the discipline. Emphasis is on
computing activities of both practical and intellectual interest, and on theoretical studies of efficient algorithms and the
limits of computation. Computer facilities are available for class assignments, team projects, and individual studies.
Students are challenged to seek original insights throughout their study. Working in teams, participating in summer
internships, supporting student professional organizations, and developing interdisciplinary projects are strongly
encouraged.

The computer science major provides an excellent back- ground for medical studies, and the flexibility provided by its
many open electives allows students to prepare for medical school while earning a degree in computer science with a
normal load in four years. Interested students should discuss their plans with their computer science adviser in the fall of
their first year.

In addition to the bachelor of science, the master of science and doctor of philosophy are also awarded in
computer science. Many students choose to double major in mathematics.

## Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program provides recognition for select undergraduates who have
experienced advanced study in computer science. Students who have an overall GPA of 3.5 or better, a GPA of 3.5 or
better in computer science classes, and six hours of any combination
of undergraduate research (CS 3860 and 3861) and 6000-level courses will be granted honors in the computer science
program. The diploma designation is Honors in Computer Science.
